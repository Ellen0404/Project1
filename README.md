# Traveller

<strong> Name </strong>

The name of this app is <i>Traveller </i> as it is designed to provide information in advance about the place where the user is planing to visit and organise the list of things and events that need to be done before and during the trip.

<strong>Description</strong>

As web developers, we want a deployed portfolio that can showcase our work to potential employers and clients. It is in that spirit that our program <i>Denver University coding bootcamp</i> required us to do some project of our choice starting from scratch. For this first project, we decided to make an application that a traveler user can use to organize, prepare and get information in advance about the place is visiting.

<strong>Programs used</strong>

We used HTML, CSS, Javascript, jquery and materialize library. We also used Git/Github as a version control and differrent APIs such us weather and googlemap APIs.

<strong>Installation</strong>

This is only a website and does not need installation. it is currently hosted in github and you can access it at https://to be added/

<strong>Usage</strong>

The page is simple, clean, easy to use and undertand. It is like a digital agenda. it provides information in advance about the place where the user is planning to visit and all the user to add and organise the list of things and events that need to be done before and during the trip. When you first load the page, it will provide you an input area for the city your are going to visit and a search button. Type the city and click the search button. once clicked, different information about the city you entered will appear on the page, such as weather information, image of the city and so on. below the search button you will also have a todo list container that you can use to add and delete things that you need to do or you are planing to do before and during your trip.
